            "content": "<h2>Searching</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    You can enter search criteria by typing into the text boxes or selecting an option from a pick list. You may also click one of the \"Display options\" to choose the format of your results (\"List\" is the default) or to limit the number and type of results you wish to receive. Any combination of fields may be used.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Some fields have an option of searching as either \"keyword\", \"phrase\", or \"exact\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>Keyword</strong>: This will return all records that contain all of the words entered in that input field, in any order (e.g. searching <tt>letter from</tt> will match <i>Letter to Tom Marioni from Vito Acconci, Handwritten letter from Doug to Stanley,</i> etc.)\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>Phrase</strong>: This will match the search terms in order anywhere in the field (e.g. searching <tt>letter from</tt> will returns only 162 records, whereas the same search as keywords (which finds the terms in any order) returns 872.\r\n    <li>\r\n        <strong>Exact</strong>: This will only return records where the field value is <i>exactly</i> what you input (e.g. an exact search for the Title <tt>letter from</tt> will retrieve 0 records whereas the keyword search for this term will retrieve 872.)\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Displaying Search Results</h2></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your search has one or more results, you'll see three panes presented -- Results, Facets, and Maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three options for display.\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n    <li><strong>List</strong> is ideal for seeing summaries of many records at once.\r\n    <li><strong>Full</strong> shows the full details of each record, including images.\r\n    <li><strong>Grid</strong> is ideal for viewing many specimens at once while also displaying images. \r\n    <br> \r\n    Clicking the specimen ID number in any view will bring you to the Full view of that specimen. Clicking an image will open the full resolution image in a new tab.\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Facets</h3>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n        After performing a search, clicking the \"Facets\" tab will show you a list, in descending frequency order, of values which appear the records returned by your search. For example, if you search for artist <tt>Marioni, Tom</tt> (exact), you will see under Materials <i>\"black-and-white photograph\" 105, \"ink on file folder\" 8, </i> etc., meaning there are 105 black-and-white photographs, 8 works in ink on file folder, etc. Clicking on the name of a facet will refine your search, returning only the results matching that value.\r\n        <br>\r\n        For most fields, the sum of the facet counts will equal the total number of records. The exception is the collector field. Since there can be multiple collectors for a single specimen, the collector counts can exceed the total number of records. For example, search for collector Setchell and view the facets tab.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Maps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may choose two different mapping options for your result set:\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n    <li><blockquote><strong>Berkeley Mapper</strong>: your results will be passed to Berkeley Mapper and plotted there.</blockquote>\r\n    <li><p><strong>Google Static Maps</strong>: up to 65 of your results will be plotted on the spot using Google Maps.\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that only records which have LatLongs will be plotted!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Statistics</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis option permits further analyses of the returned values. Select the field on which you want a summary (count), then select fields to be displayed associated with that count and select \u201cDisplay Summary\u201d. Scroll to the bottom of the displayed data for the count(s). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using a Downloaded .csv File</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Search results and Summary statistics can be downloaded to your local computer in \".csv\" format (\"character-separated values\").  Specifically, the displayed table is saved to a file with the cells separated by tabs and the rows separated by \"carriage returns\". There is no encapsulation of the values (i.e. quotes around strings).  Most spreadsheet programs will open these files straightforwardly, but there are some tricks:\r\n    <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\r\n        <li>To open (import) the file in FileMaker Pro, you should change the extension from .csv to .tab; then FMP will handle the file properly.\r\n        <li>To open the file in Open Office, open the file and set the Text Import settings as follows : under \"Separated by\" select Tab as the delimiter and make sure the Text Delimiter is empty.\r\n        <li>To open the file in MS Excel, try the following (the process differs from version to version of Windows and Excel, good hunting!):\r\n        <ol style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n            <li>Open Excel\r\n            <li>File -> New (i.e. make a new blank workbook)\r\n            <li>Data -> From Text (i.e. under the Data menu Item, click \"From Text\" at the left)\r\n            <li>Imports (under Tools at the bottom of the window)\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>check Delimited\r\n                <li>check My Data has Headers\r\n                <li>click Next\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>select Tab for delimiter\r\n                <li>{None} for encapsulating character\r\n                <li>click Next\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <li>In this window:\r\n            <ol type=\"a\" style=\"margin-left: 30px;\">\r\n                <li>highlight the first column of the data file (accession number)\r\n                <li>select Text as the format for this column\r\n                <li>click OK\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>",
