Clicking the museum number in any view will bring\r\n        you to the Full view of that object. Clicking an image will open the full\r\n        resolution image in a new tab.\r\n    </li>\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Facets</h3>\r\n\r\n    <p>After performing a search, clicking the \"Facets\" tab will show you a list, in descending frequency order,\r\n        of values which appear the records returned by your search. For example, if you search for Artist\r\n        <tt>Hofmann, Hans</tt> (exact), you will see under Classification \r\n        <i>\"Photograph\u201d 88, \"Painting\u201d 50 </i> etc., meaning there are\r\n        88 photographs and 50 paintings by Hans Hofmann, etc.\r\n        Clicking on the name of a facet will refine your search, returning only the results matching that value.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Statistics</h3>\r\n<p>The Statistics pane allows you to count the number of values that occur for items in your search result. It is useful for simple statistical summaries and cross-tabulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if search for <a target=\"new\" href=\"https://webapps.cspace.berkeley.edu/bampfa/search/search/?datemade=1820&datemade_qualifier=keyword&displayType=list&maxresults=100&start=1\">works created in 1820 (\"date made = 1820\")</a>, you could select \"Artist\" as the \"field to summarize on:\" in the Statistics pane, then click \"Display Summary\", and you'd get a list of the artists whose works were made in that year, with a count of the number of those works.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that this function summarizes the results of the current search, not of the entire collection.</p>\r\n",
